# vault_proj — Master Task List

Start here. Tasks are grouped by track and ordered roughly easiest → hardest
within each group. Inline `TODO(you)` markers in the code point back to these
items. Tick them off as you go.

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` partially scaffolded · `[x]` done

**Suggested order:** §0 Bootstrap → §1 Local CLI → §2 Core concepts (mix theory
+ CLI) → §3 K8s Vault + demo app → §4 TTL / rotation → §5 Hardening (optional).

Pair each section with the matching chapter in `docs/CONCEPTS.md`.

## Problem

Your team ships a tiny backend that needs a database password and HTTPS. Today
those values are either hardcoded, stuffed into a Kubernetes Secret by hand, or
copied from a chat message. There is no expiry, no audit trail, and rotating
the password means a scary outage.

**Done looks like:** you can explain Vault’s model out loud; run Vault on your
laptop and exercise KV, tokens, leases, seal/unseal; deploy Vault + the demo
app on a local cluster so the app obtains secrets (and optionally a TLS cert
from Vault PKI) without baking credentials into the image; demonstrate renew,
revoke, and a simple rotation path.

---

## Learning outcomes

- Explain the problem Vault solves vs env vars / plain K8s Secrets
- Use the Vault CLI for KV, auth, tokens, leases
- Describe seal/unseal, policies, and namespace isolation (incl. lock/unlock)
- Run Vault and a demo app on local Kubernetes
- Issue TLS with Vault PKI (private CA — no paid CA)
- Practice TTL, renew, revoke, and rotation

---

## 0. Bootstrap

- [x] Install tools: `mise install` from `ops/vault_proj`.
- [x] Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and skim the variables (no real secrets needed for `-dev`).
- [x] **Verify:** `vault version`, `kubectl version --client`, `helm version`.
- [x] Skim `README.md` (problem statement + mental model) and `docs/CONCEPTS.md` §1–2.

---

## 1. Local CLI lab (no Kubernetes)

Vault’s `-dev` mode auto-unseals, prints a root token, and stores data in memory.
Perfect for learning the CLI — **never** use `-dev` in production.

- [x] **Task:** start Vault: `mise run vault-dev`. Note the root token and
      `VAULT_ADDR` (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8200`).
- [x] Export in your shell: `export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` and
      `export VAULT_TOKEN=<root-token-from-dev-output>`.
- [x] **Verify:** `vault status` shows `Sealed: false` and `HA Enabled: false`.
- [x] Run the guided script: `mise run local-kv-demo` (or step through
      `scripts/local-kv-demo.sh` yourself).
- [x] **Task:** enable KV v2 yourself if the script did not:
      `vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2`
- [x] **Task:** write and read a secret:
      ```bash
      vault kv put secret/demo/db username=app password=s3cret
      vault kv get secret/demo/db
      vault kv get -field=password secret/demo/db
      ```
- [x] **Task:** create a **policy** file that only allows `read` on
      `secret/data/demo/*`, then create a child token with that policy.
      See `TODO(you)` in `scripts/local-kv-demo.sh` and CONCEPTS § Authentication / Tokens.
- [x] **Verify:** with the child token, `vault kv get secret/demo/db` works;
      writing should fail.

## 2. Core Vault concepts (theory + practice)

Work through `docs/CONCEPTS.md` while doing the CLI checks below.

### 2a. Seal / unseal

- [ ] **Read:** CONCEPTS — Seal & unseal.
- [ ] **Task:** with `-dev`, run `vault operator seal`, then `vault status`.
- [ ] **Task:** unseal is different in `-dev` (often restart is easiest). Then try
      the **file storage** path: copy `local/vault-config.hcl.example` →
      `local/vault-config.hcl`, run `mise run vault-file`, go through
      `vault operator init` and `vault operator unseal` (3 of 5 keys by default).
- [ ] **Verify:** after sealing, API reads fail until unsealed; after unseal,
      `vault status` shows `Sealed: false`.

### 2b. Authentication & tokens

- [ ] **Read:** CONCEPTS — Auth methods & tokens.
- [ ] **Task:** `vault token lookup` on your root token — note `ttl`, `renewable`, `policies`.
- [ ] **Task:** create a periodic or renewable token with your limited policy;
      `vault token renew`; `vault token revoke`.
- [ ] **Verify:** after revoke, that token can no longer read secrets.

### 2c. Leases — renew & revoke

- [ ] **Read:** CONCEPTS — Leases.
- [ ] **Task:** enable the `transit` or use a dynamic-ish path. Easiest beginner
      path: create a token with a short TTL (`-ttl=60s`), watch it expire, and
      practice `vault lease` / `vault token renew` before expiry.
- [ ] Optional stretch: enable the **database** secrets engine against a local
      Postgres and issue a dynamic role credential; `vault lease renew` /
      `vault lease revoke` on the lease id.
- [ ] **Verify:** after revoke/expiry, the credential no longer works.

### 2d. Namespaces (lock / unlock)

Open-source Vault does **not** include namespaces (Enterprise / HCP feature).
Still learn the model — it shows up in real jobs.

- [ ] **Read:** CONCEPTS — Namespaces.
- [ ] **Task (theory):** explain in your own words what a namespace isolates and
      what “namespace lock” does to API access inside that namespace.
- [ ] **Task (practice substitute on OSS):** use **separate mount paths + policies**
      to simulate two teams (`secret/team-a/...` vs `secret/team-b/...`) so each
      token can only see its path. Document the mapping in a short note under
      `docs/` (optional `docs/namespaces-oss-lab.md`).
- [ ] If you have access to HCP Vault / Enterprise later: practice
      `vault namespace lock` / `unlock` and confirm clients get errors while locked.

---

## 3. Kubernetes: Vault + demo app

Goal: the demo API in `app/` obtains a backend secret from Vault (not from a
hardcoded string). TLS via Vault PKI is in §3d.

- [ ] Create a local cluster: `mise run cluster-k3d` (or `cluster-kind`).
- [ ] **Verify:** `kubectl get nodes` is Ready.
- [~] Install Vault with the local values overlay:
      `mise run vault-install` (uses `charts/vault-values/values-local.yaml`).
- [ ] **Verify:** Vault pod(s) Running; port-forward or use the chart’s service;
      `vault status` against the in-cluster address (see mise task output).
- [ ] **Task:** complete `TODO(you)` in `charts/vault-values/values-local.yaml`
      (dev vs standalone, UI, injector/agent notes).
- [ ] Enable KV in the cluster Vault and write `secret/demo/db` (same shape as local).
- [ ] Configure **Kubernetes auth** (or AppRole) so the demo-app ServiceAccount
      can read that path. Fill `TODO(you)` in `scripts/k8s-bootstrap.sh`.
- [ ] Build & load the app image: `mise run app-build`.
- [ ] Install the chart: `mise run app-install`.
- [ ] **Task:** finish `TODO(you)` in `app/main.py` so `/secret` (or `/health`’s
      dependency) reads from Vault using the pod’s auth method — not a hardcoded password.
- [ ] **Verify:** `kubectl port-forward svc/demo-app 8080:8080` then
      `curl -s localhost:8080/health` and `curl -s localhost:8080/secret` show
      success without printing the raw password in logs if you can avoid it.

### 3d. TLS with Vault PKI (no paid CA)

- [ ] **Read:** CONCEPTS — PKI.
- [ ] **Task:** enable `pki` secrets engine; generate a root (or intermediate) CA;
      create a role for `demo-app.local`.
- [ ] **Task:** issue a cert; create a Kubernetes TLS secret (or use Vault Agent /
      CSI — your choice). Wire `charts/demo-app` to serve HTTPS or mount the cert.
      See `TODO(you)` in `charts/demo-app/templates/` and `values-local.yaml`.
- [ ] **Verify:** `curl -k https://…` works; inspect the cert issuer — it should
      be your Vault CA, not a public CA.

---

## 4. Expiration, rotation, renew, revoke

- [ ] Set a short TTL on a KV v2 custom metadata or on a token/dynamic secret
      you use for the demo (`ttl` / `max_ttl` on roles).
- [ ] **Task:** demonstrate **renew** before expiry and **revoke** mid-life;
      show the app or CLI failing after revoke.
- [ ] **Task:** implement a simple **rotation** runbook (manual is fine):
      1) write new password to Vault (new KV version),
      2) reload/restart app or rely on Agent template refresh,
      3) invalidate old version / revoke old lease.
      Capture the steps in `docs/rotation-runbook.md` (create it).
- [ ] **Verify:** old credential stops working; new one works; you can point to
      an audit-friendly sequence of commands.

---

## 5. Hardening (optional)

- [ ] Turn off Vault `-dev` / `devserver` for the K8s install; use file or raft
      storage with init + unseal keys stored safely **outside** git.
- [ ] Add least-privilege policies (app can read only its path).
- [ ] NetworkPolicy: only demo-app can reach Vault on 8200 in-cluster.
- [ ] Enable an audit device (`file` is fine for the lab) and find your `kv get`
      in the log.
- [ ] Replace root token usage with AppRole or K8s auth everywhere in scripts.
